1. Activate the yeast by adding the yeast and the sugar to the warm water.

2. In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the middle and add
the olive oil and bloomed yeast mixture. Using a spoon, mix until a shaggy dough
begins to form.

3. Once the flour is mostly hydrated, turn the dough out onto a clean work surface
and knead for 10-15 minutes. The dough should be soft. Form the dough into a taut
round.

4. Grease a clean, large bowl with olive oil and place the dough inside, turning to
coat with the oil. Cover with plastic wrap. Let rise for at least an hour, or up to
24 hours.

5. Punch down the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured work surface. Knead
for another minute or so, then cut into 4 equal portions and shape into rounds.

6. Lightly flour the dough, then cover with a kitchen towel and let rest for another
30 minutes to an hour while you prepare the sauce and any other ingredients.

7. Preheat the microwave and place the pizza pan in it.

8. Meanwhile, make the tomato sauce: Add the salt to the can of tomatoes and puree
to a blender and blend until smooth.

9. Once the dough has rested, take a portion and start by poking the surface with
your fingertips, until bubbles form and do not deflate.

10. Then, stretch and press the dough into a thin round. Make it thinner than you 
think it should be, as it will slightly shrink and puff up during baking.

11. Sprinkle semolina onto an upside down baking sheet and place the stretched crust 
onto it. Add the sauce and ingredients of your choice.

12. Place the pizza base on the preheated pan. Bake for 15 minutes, or until the 
crust and cheese are golden brown.

13. Add any garnish of your preference.
